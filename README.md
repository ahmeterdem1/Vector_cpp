# Vector

The same vector library, in c++.

## General Methods

I try to stick to the same conventions
that i have used for the python version.
These include variatic argument initializations.
I don't like to use array inputs.

Variatic arguments came at a cost though, 
for now at least. Vector's values all must be
float. You need to at least put a dot after the
number. Otherwise typecasting just stops working.

I won't exlpain each method here because they are
the same as their python version. Just maybe faster.

I really would like to go deep in algorithms with
matrix multiplication and determinants though, this
is the only reason that I have decided to code this
library in C++ too.

And I would like this library to be more high level
than general C++ code. What I mean by that is like,
having exception classes and _maybe_ some built in 
logging.
